# Freshservice Time Kick (API)

A lightweight Edge extension to log time, update status, and add notes to Freshservice tickets via the API.

## Features

* **Multi-Action Panel:** Log time, update ticket status, and add a public noteâ€”all in one click.
* **Fast Access:** Use the toolbar popup or keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+L` or `MacCtrl+Shift+L`) to open the action panel.
* **Smart UI:** "Log Time" is the default action. Changing the status dropdown automatically enables the "Update Status" action.
* **Direct API:** Logs time and updates directly via the Freshservice v2 API.
* **Configurable:** Set your API credentials and defaults for minutes, note, and billable status.
* **Secure:** Stores your API key in browser-synced storage.
